[Yes, the concept of `String` and `StringBuilder` is indeed related to Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[2](https://www.techiedelight.com/difference-between-string-stringbuilder-java/). Here are the key points:

1. [**Immutability**: In Java, `String` objects are **immutable**, which means once a `String` object is created, it cannot be changed](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[2](https://www.techiedelight.com/difference-between-string-stringbuilder-java/). [If you perform any operation that modifies the `String`, it will create a new `String` object](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[2](https://www.techiedelight.com/difference-between-string-stringbuilder-java/). On the other hand, `StringBuilder` is **mutable**. [It allows you to make modifications to the existing string object without creating a new one](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[2](https://www.techiedelight.com/difference-between-string-stringbuilder-java/).

2. [**Performance**: Due to the immutability of `String`, if you perform repetitive operations or manipulations on a `String`, it can be costly in terms of performance because each operation creates a new `String` object](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[2](https://www.techiedelight.com/difference-between-string-stringbuilder-java/)[`StringBuilder` provides an optimized way to deal with repetitive and multiple string manipulation operations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[2](https://www.techiedelight.com/difference-between-string-stringbuilder-java/).

Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate the difference in Java:

```java
class GFG {
    public static void concat1 (String s1) {
        s1 = s1 + "forgeeks";
    }

    public static void concat2 (StringBuilder s2) {
        s2.append ("forgeeks");
    }

    public static void main (String [] args) {
        String s1 = "Geeks";
        concat1 (s1);
        System.out.println ("String: " + s1);

        StringBuilder s2 = new StringBuilder ("Geeks");
        concat2 (s2);
        System.out.println ("StringBuilder: " + s2);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `String` `s1` remains unchanged after the `concat1` method due to the immutability of `String`. [However, the `StringBuilder` `s2` is changed after the `concat2` method because `StringBuilder` is mutable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/).

In general, if a string is going to remain constant throughout the program, then use `String`. [If a string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string), then using a `StringBuilder` is the best option](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/).
