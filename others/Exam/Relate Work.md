I am writing my thesis paper titled "An Empyrical Study of deep learning models for remote sensing image classification". I used these datasets (EuroSAT Dataset, UCMerced Dataset - Land-Use Scene Classification, NWPU-RESISC45 Dataset, PatternNet Dataset, AID dataset, WHU-RS19, so2sat dataset, RSScN7) and I fed them to a hybrid model with EfficientNetB0 (last 50 trainable layers) + ResNet50 (last 20 trainable layers)

Now I need to write "Related Work" section for my paper. I've collected some reference papers, with citation numbers which is given below. Please write me a comrprehensive "Related Work" for my paper and maintain the citation tags/numbers for example [1] that is added for the specific paper to the "Related Work" that you write:

wait, you take this information and remember it because in the next response I will provide you with 17 more reference paper that you need to look into for writing my "Related Work" section because I can't fit all of them in current message because of word limit.
