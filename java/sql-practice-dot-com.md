- Display every patient's first_name.  
  Order the list by the length of each name and then by alphabetically.

Below code will show error because: In SQL, you canâ€™t use theÂ `AND`Â operator betweenÂ `ORDER BY`Â clauses. If you want to order by multiple columns or expressions, you should separate them with commas.

```sql
-- this code shows error
select patients.first_name
from patients order by len(patients.first_name) AND 
order by patients.first_name ASC; 


-- And below code is correct
select patients.first_name
from patients order by len(patients.first_name), patients.first_name ASC;
```



- Show the total amount of male patients and the total amount of female patients in the patients table.  
  Display the two results in the same row.

I know aggregate functions but it will print in two rows: one for Female and other for Male

so I did it like this:

```sql
-- this code shows result in two rows
select patients.gender, count(patients.gender)
from patients
group by patients.gender;
```

but how in same row? let's see.

Sure, letâ€™s consider a hypothetical `patients` table with the following data:

| id  | first_name | last_name | gender |
| --- | ---------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1   | John       | Doe       | M      |
| 2   | Jane       | Doe       | F      |
| 3   | Alice      | Smith     | F      |
| 4   | Bob        | Johnson   | M      |
| 5   | Charlie    | Brown     | M      |

1. For the first query:
   
   ```sql
   (SELECT COUNT(patients.gender) FROM patients WHERE patients.gender = 'M'), 
   (SELECT COUNT(patients.gender) FROM patients WHERE patients.gender = 'F')
   ```
   
   You will get two separate values as the result. The output might look something like this:
   
   ```
   3
   2
   ```
   
   This means there are 3 male patients and 2 female patients.

2. For the second query:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT
   (SELECT COUNT(patients.gender) FROM patients WHERE patients.gender = 'M'), 
   (SELECT COUNT(patients.gender) FROM patients WHERE patients.gender = 'F')
   ```
   
   You will get a single row with two columns as the result. The output might look something like this:
   
   | M_count | F_count |
   | ------- | ------- |
   | 3       | 2       |
   
   This means there are 3 male patients and 2 female patients.

The difference in the output is due to how SQL handles multiple `SELECT` statements:

1. In the first query, you have two separate `SELECT` statements. Each `SELECT` statement is executed independently and returns its own result. So, you get two separate values as the result.

2. In the second query, you have a single `SELECT` statement that includes two subqueries. Each subquery returns a single value, and these values are returned as two separate columns in a single row. So, you get a single row with two columns as the result.

In summary, the first query returns two separate values because it consists of two separate `SELECT` statements. The second query returns a single row with two columns because it is a single `SELECT` statement that includes two subqueries.

I hope this clarifies the difference! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
