- Display every patient's first_name.  
  Order the list by the length of each name and then by alphabetically.

Below code will show error because: In SQL, you canâ€™t use theÂ `AND`Â operator betweenÂ `ORDER BY`Â clauses. If you want to order by multiple columns or expressions, you should separate them with commas.

```sql
-- this code shows error
select patients.first_name
from patients order by len(patients.first_name) AND 
order by patients.first_name ASC; 


-- And below code is correct
select patients.first_name
from patients order by len(patients.first_name), patients.first_name ASC;
```

- Show the total amount of male patients and the total amount of female patients in the patients table.  
  Display the two results in the same row.

I know aggregate functions but it will print in two rows: one for Female and other for Male

so I did it like this:

```sql
-- this code shows result in two rows
select patients.gender, count(patients.gender)
from patients
group by patients.gender;
```

but how in same row? let's see.

Sure, letâ€™s consider a hypothetical `patients` table with the following data:

| id  | first_name | last_name | gender |
| --- | ---------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1   | John       | Doe       | M      |
| 2   | Jane       | Doe       | F      |
| 3   | Alice      | Smith     | F      |
| 4   | Bob        | Johnson   | M      |
| 5   | Charlie    | Brown     | M      |

1. For the first query:
   
   ```sql
   (SELECT COUNT(patients.gender) FROM patients WHERE patients.gender = 'M'), 
   (SELECT COUNT(patients.gender) FROM patients WHERE patients.gender = 'F')
   ```
   
   You will get two separate values as the result. The output might look something like this:
   
   ```
   3
   2
   ```
   
   This means there are 3 male patients and 2 female patients.

2. For the second query:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT
   (SELECT COUNT(patients.gender) FROM patients WHERE patients.gender = 'M'), 
   (SELECT COUNT(patients.gender) FROM patients WHERE patients.gender = 'F')
   ```
   
   You will get a single row with two columns as the result. The output might look something like this:
   
   | M_count | F_count |
   | ------- | ------- |
   | 3       | 2       |
   
   This means there are 3 male patients and 2 female patients.

The difference in the output is due to how SQL handles multiple `SELECT` statements:

1. In the first query, you have two separate `SELECT` statements. Each `SELECT` statement is executed independently and returns its own result. So, you get two separate values as the result.

2. In the second query, you have a single `SELECT` statement that includes two subqueries. Each subquery returns a single value, and these values are returned as two separate columns in a single row. So, you get a single row with two columns as the result.

In summary, the first query returns two separate values because it consists of two separate `SELECT` statements. The second query returns a single row with two columns because it is a single `SELECT` statement that includes two subqueries.

I hope this clarifies the difference! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š

- Show patient_id, diagnosis from admissions. Find patients admitted multiple times for the same diagnosis.

```sql
This won't work:
select admissions.patient_id, admissions.diagnosis
from admissions
group by admissions.diagnosis
having count(admissions.diagnosis) > 1; 

this works:
select admissions.patient_id, admissions.diagnosis
from admissions
group by admissions.patient_id, admissions.diagnosis
having count(admissions.diagnosis) > 1; 


this also works:
having count(*) > 1 / having count(admissions.patient_id) > 1 
/ having count(admissions.discharge_date) > 1 .... etc.
```

- Show the province_id(s), sum of height; where the total sum of its patient's height is greater than or equal to 7,000.

```sql
Alhamdulillah!
select patients.province_id, sum(patients.height)
from patients
group by patients.province_id
having sum(patients.height) >= 7000;
```

```sql
this also works!
select patients.province_id, sum(patients.height)
from patients
join province_names on patients.province_id = province_names.province_id
group by patients.province_id
having sum(patients.height) >= 7000;
```

* display the first name, last name and number of duplicate patients based on their first name and last name.  
  
  Ex: A patient with an identical name can be considered a duplicate.

```sql
Alhamdulillah! simiar to the admitted multiple times queston

select patients.first_name, patients.last_name, count(*)
from patients
group by patients.first_name, patients.last_name
having count(*) > 1
```



- ```sql
  here, I want to do a where statement where patients.allergies <> null. 
  my question is, in which line below should I insert this where statement ?
  select patients.allergies
  from patients
  group by patients.allergies
  order by count(patients.allergies) desc
  ```

You should insert the `WHERE` clause after the `FROM` clause and before the `GROUP BY` clause. Hereâ€™s how your SQL query should look:

```sql
SELECT patients.allergies
FROM patients
WHERE patients.allergies IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY patients.allergies
ORDER BY COUNT(patients.allergies) DESC
```

In this query, `patients.allergies IS NOT NULL` will filter out the records where `allergies` is `NULL` before grouping and counting. Please note that in SQL, to check for `NULL`, we use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`, not `<> NULL`. The `<>` operator does not work with `NULL` values.
