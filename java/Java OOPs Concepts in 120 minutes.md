class is a blueprint of an object which brings the question as what is object an object is basically an instance of the class.

a class is technically a logical entity

We can think of class as an entity in the world. we say that java is heavily inspired from real life examples and classes and objects are the reason we say that because whatever you see in the world is always basically

some entity - human beings are an entity, cars are an entity, students are an entity ,so all the actors which we see in the world are basically entities and we can map them as classes.

in java why do we want to map them - because these entities have basically

two kind of specifications - Every entity will have some attributes and it will have some behavior and actually that is how you identify an entity for example human

beings have attributes like we have hands we have eyes we have ears legs etc

these are our attributes. Then we have our behaviors. Behaviors are actions. Human being can speak so speaking is an action - it's abehavior. 

they can listen - is an action, it's a behavior. Can walk is an action is a behavior

similarly can eat is also an action or a behavior so that's how you basically represent an entity.



<u>*Entities have attributes and behaviors. if we see those two specifications in any entity we can map that entity or  write that enity as a class because a class in java - Will exactly have these two properties it will have some attributes which are called fields or member variables and it will have some behaviors which are called as methods so it will have attributes and behaviours similar to real-world entity*</u>



Together, the methods and fields of a class are commonly referred to as its members. Members encapsulate the behavior (methods) and state (fields) of the class. So, when discussing the components that make up a class in Java, you can use the term "class members" to encompass both methods and fields.
