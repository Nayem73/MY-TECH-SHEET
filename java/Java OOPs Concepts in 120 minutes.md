What is OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming principle that uses the concept of ‚Äúobjects‚Äù to design software. Objects are instances of classes, which are like blueprints. [Each object can have unique values for the properties defined in the class](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)[1](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). Here are some key points you can mention during an interview:

1. **Definition**: OOP is a paradigm where the complete software operates as a bunch of objects talking to each other. [An object is a collection of data and the methods which operate on that data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

2. **Advantages**: OOP provides better manageable code. It increases the overall understanding of the software as the distance between the language spoken by developers and that spoken by users is reduced. [It also eases maintenance by the use of encapsulation](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

3. **Class**: A class is a user-defined data type that contains the data members and member functions that operate on the data members. [It is like a blueprint or template of objects having common properties and methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

4. **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. Data members and methods of a class cannot be used directly. [We need to create an object (or instance) of the class to use them](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

5. [**Main Features**: The four main concepts or principles of OOPs are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

Remember, it‚Äôs important to provide examples when explaining these concepts to demonstrate your practical understanding of OOP. Good luck with your interview! üòä

<u><strong>by Me:</strong></u> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming method that uses the concept of ‚Äúobjects‚Äù. Now, what is object? Objects are instances of classes, We know classes as the blueprints from which we can create multiple objects.

# why do we need class?

# Class Initialize korar jonno oi class er constructor call kora lage. for example:

* ```java
  Car car = new Car(); //init by empty constructor
  Animal animal = new Animal("Dog", "brown", 2); //init by constructor with parameters
  ```

## java will force you to find entities which will have attributes and behaviours. That entity will be a java class.

class is a blueprint of an object which brings the question as what is object an object is basically an instance of the class.

a class is technically a logical entity

We can think of class as an entity in the world. we say that java is heavily inspired from real life examples and classes and objects are the reason we say that because whatever you see in the world is always basically

some entity - human beings are an entity, cars are an entity, students are an entity ,so all the actors which we see in the world are basically entities and we can map them as classes.

in java why do we want to map them - because these entities have basically

two kind of specifications - Every entity will have some attributes and it will have some behavior and actually that is how you identify an entity for example human

beings have attributes like we have hands we have eyes we have ears legs etc

these are our attributes. Then we have our behaviors. Behaviors are actions. Human being can speak so speaking is an action - it's abehavior. 

they can listen - is an action, it's a behavior. Can walk is an action is a behavior

similarly can eat is also an action or a behavior so that's how you basically represent an entity.

<u>*Entities have attributes and behaviors. if we see those two specifications in any entity we can map that entity or  write that enity as a class because a class in java - Will exactly have these two properties it will have some attributes which are called fields or member variables and it will have some behaviors which are called as methods so it will have attributes and behaviours similar to real-world entity*</u>

Together, the methods and fields of a class are commonly referred to as its members. Members encapsulate the behavior (methods) and state (fields) of the class. So, when discussing the components that make up a class in Java, you can use the term "class members" to encompass both methods and fields.

## why do we need it?

when a client provides me his requirements for a particular project, I will be able to identify the attributes and behaviors of the entities of that project and able to create classes according to the requirements. Thats how I would be able to transfer the real world requirements of a project into code.

# inside a class

* how do you initialize objects/attributes/fields in a classe? -> through setters and constructors.

## Access Modifiers

![](assets/2023-12-26-17-00-56-image.png)

Access modifiers are used to only expose the attributes, methods and classes which are supposed to be exposed to the consumer.

# Inheritance

* Inheritance is a key principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class

* When we have multiple classes to share similar behaviour(mehtods) and attributes(fields)

* For example, let's say we have banking system, we can have commercial account, personal account, loan account etc. In these classes, we have some common behavior but at the same time we also have some different behavior so whenever you have such scenario always think about applying the concept of inheritance.

* here's another simple way to spot whether inheritance can be used at a particular place or not: 
  
  Inheritance is also used when there's a relationship(relationship of a super class and subclass/'es) between two entities or classes. whenever you read the requirements from a client just try to find the words which use this particular phrase "is a"
  
  - for example car "is a" vehicle. 
  
  - savings account "is a" type of account.

# Encapsulation

* Encapsulation is basically to combine methods and attributes in a single unit which we know as a class and protect  the attributes/properties of the class to the outside world(package) by using different access modifiers Which allows us to have full contol on how the outside world can access or modify the attributes.

* We have full control of the class:
  
  * We control the visibility/access of the attributes/fields
  
  * We control how they should be assigned through setters
  
  * We control how they should be accessed through getters

# Abstraction

* Abstraction is a concept of (OOP) that hides the implementation details and shows only the essential features. We achieve it by using abstract classes, abstract methods and interfaces.
* Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user and providing only the functionality to the user.
* With abstraction, we can avoid duplicate codes and write better code. Let's say we have a parent class and we have multiple subclasses that extends from the parent class. All of these subclasses overrides the same method of the parent class and implements their own functionalities. Now, if that method in the parent class had any implemented code in it's method body, it would be wasted code since all the subclasses overrides it to implement their own functionalities. So we need to make that method an abstract method to avoid duplicates or unnecessary codes. Now, to make that method as an abstract method, we need to make that parent class abstract as well, which means we can not create any instance of the parent class, which is fine anyway and even better, because we are using it as a blueprint for the subclasses to organize the subclasses and we only need instance of the subclasses.
* abstract classes cannot be instantiated explicitly. They can only be instantiated by the child classes through the internal mechanisms of java itself (inheritance)
* Abstraction is necessary when we want subclasses to inherit from a super class and when we only need the objects of those subclasses. For example, we make a generic class for all type of Vehicles as Vehicle and Car, Bike, CNG etc. will extend from that class and in such cases we will only work with these subclasses. So we make Vehicle as an abstract class.
* So why we make Vehicle as abstract? Of course we will have some common methods and attributes inside the Vehicle class that all Vehicle should have, for example each vehicle has tires, but the layout or number of tires can be different, so we have some common characteristics but we cannot implement the exact type. So we should declare a common method and let the sub classes override it and implement their own functionalities. This is where we need to make Abstract methods. And of course to achieve this functionality, to avoid code duplication and write better code, we need to make the parent class abstract as well, only then we can use abstract methods.
* So why do we need to declare the abstract method in the parent class at all? the base classes can just create these methods on their own anyway. - The reason is, to organize and to enforce every subclass of class animal that every subclass must have.

<u>**other functionalities of abstraction aside for what I've just described:**</u>

Absolutely, abstraction in programming has several other important functionalities beyond what you‚Äôve described:

1. [**Simplification**: Abstraction simplifies the process of understanding complex systems by allowing us to focus on high-level concepts rather than the details](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-abstraction-in-programming/)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-abstraction-in-programming/)[2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-abstraction-in-programming-for-beginners/).

2. [**Code Reusability**: Abstraction helps to reduce code duplication and improves reusability](https://www.programmingcube.com/why-do-we-use-abstraction-in-programming/)[3](https://www.programmingcube.com/why-do-we-use-abstraction-in-programming/). By creating abstract classes or interfaces, we can define common methods and properties that can be shared across multiple classes.

3. [**Security**: Abstraction contributes to the security of an application by exposing only necessary information to the user](https://www.programmingcube.com/why-do-we-use-abstraction-in-programming/)[3](https://www.programmingcube.com/why-do-we-use-abstraction-in-programming/). This is often referred to as data hiding or encapsulation.

4. [**Code Maintainability**: Abstraction fosters code maintainability](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-abstraction-in-programming/)[4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-are-abstractions-important-in-system-design/). By separating concerns into different classes or modules, we can make changes to one part of the system without affecting others.

5. [**Collaboration**: Abstraction facilitates collaboration among developers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-abstraction-in-programming/)[4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-are-abstractions-important-in-system-design/). Developers can work concurrently on different components of the application, ensuring modularity and reducing dependencies.

6. **Understanding and Using Libraries/Frameworks**: You don‚Äôt need to know the inner workings of a function or framework in programming to use it. [But knowing how those things work can make you a better programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-abstraction-in-programming/)[1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-abstraction-in-programming/).

Remember, the goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity by breaking down problems into more manageable parts. It‚Äôs a fundamental concept in programming and is key to writing efficient, maintainable code.

**<u>Examples for these 6 functionalities:</u>**

Sure, let‚Äôs illustrate the six functionalities of abstraction with code examples in Java:

1. **Simplification**: Abstraction allows us to hide complex details behind simple interfaces. Here‚Äôs an example using a `Car` class:

```java
class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine();
    }

    public void start() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

class Engine {
    public void start() {
        // Complex code to start the engine
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class simplifies the process of starting the engine. The user doesn‚Äôt need to know how the engine starts; they just need to call the `start` method of the `Car` class.

2. **Code Reusability**: Abstraction promotes code reusability through inheritance and interfaces. Here‚Äôs an example using a `Shape` abstract class and `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes:

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing rectangle");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing circle");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` abstract class provides a method `draw()` that is implemented by each subclass. This promotes code reusability as the `draw()` method can be used by any shape.

3. **Security**: Abstraction contributes to the security of an application by exposing only necessary information to the user. This is often referred to as data hiding or encapsulation. Here‚Äôs an example:

```java
public class Employee {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `name` field is private and can only be accessed through the `getName()` and `setName()` methods. This hides the internal implementation and protects the field from being directly accessed or modified.

4. **Code Maintainability**: Abstraction fosters code maintainability. By separating concerns into different classes or modules, we can make changes to one part of the system without affecting others. The `Car` and `Engine` example above also illustrates this point.

5. **Collaboration**: Abstraction facilitates collaboration among developers. Developers can work concurrently on different components of the application, ensuring modularity and reducing dependencies. The `Shape`, `Rectangle`, and `Circle` example above also illustrates this point.

6. **Understanding and Using Libraries/Frameworks**: You don‚Äôt need to know the inner workings of a function or framework in programming to use it. But knowing how those things work can make you a better programmer. For example, when using a library or framework in Java, you often use methods without needing to understand their internal implementation. This is possible because of abstraction.

Remember, the goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity by breaking down problems into more manageable parts. It‚Äôs a fundamental concept in programming and is key to writing efficient, maintainable code. 

**<u>By chatGPT</u>**

Yes, abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) serves several purposes beyond what you've described. Here are some additional functionalities and benefits of abstraction:

1. **Encapsulation:** Abstraction often goes hand-in-hand with encapsulation, another fundamental OOP concept. Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Abstraction helps define a clear interface (through abstract methods) for interacting with the object, and the details of the implementation are hidden from the outside world.

2. **Modularity:** Abstraction supports the creation of modular code by allowing you to break down a complex system into smaller, more manageable components. Each class represents a module with its own responsibilities, and the interactions between these modules are simplified through well-defined interfaces.

3. **Code Reusability:** Abstract classes and interfaces facilitate code reuse. Once you define a common interface through an abstract class or interface, you can create multiple concrete implementations (subclasses) that adhere to that interface. This promotes reuse of code, reducing redundancy and making maintenance easier.

4. **Polymorphism:** Abstraction enables polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This facilitates flexibility and extensibility in your code. Polymorphism is often achieved through the use of interfaces or abstract classes, allowing different objects to be used interchangeably.

5. **Framework Development:** Abstraction is crucial in the development of frameworks, where the framework provides a set of abstract classes or interfaces, and users of the framework provide concrete implementations. This separation allows developers to extend and customize the framework without modifying its core code.

6. **Understanding Complexity:** Abstraction allows you to focus on the essential features of an object while ignoring unnecessary details. It simplifies the mental model of a system, making it easier to understand and reason about. This is particularly valuable in large and complex software projects.

7. **Adaptability to Change:** Abstraction helps in managing changes more effectively. If you need to modify the behavior of a system, you can often do so by creating new subclasses or implementing new interfaces without affecting the existing code that relies on the abstract classes or interfaces.

In summary, abstraction is a powerful concept in OOP that goes beyond just avoiding duplicate code. It promotes good design principles, enhances code organization, and contributes to the overall maintainability and extensibility of software systems.

**<u>Example code for above chatGPT:</u>**

Certainly! Let's implement a similar geometric shapes framework in Java, exploring abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, code reusability, polymorphism, and framework development.

```java
// 1. Abstraction and Encapsulation
abstract class Shape {
    private String name;

    public Shape(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Abstract method for calculating area
    public abstract double area();

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// 2. Modularity and Code Reusability
class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(String name, double radius) {
        super(name);
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    // Concrete implementation of the area method for Circle
    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    private double side;

    public Square(String name, double side) {
        super(name);
        this.side = side;
    }

    // Concrete implementation of the area method for Square
    @Override
    public double area() {
        return side * side;
    }
}

// 3. Polymorphism
class ShapePrinter {
    public static void printArea(Shape shape) {
        System.out.println("The area of " + shape.getName() + " is: " + shape.area());
    }
}

// 4. Framework Development
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using polymorphism to create instances of different shapes
        Shape circle = new Circle("Circle 1", 5);
        Shape square = new Square("Square 1", 4);

        // Using polymorphism to print the areas of different shapes
        ShapePrinter.printArea(circle);
        ShapePrinter.printArea(square);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Abstraction and Encapsulation (Shape class):**
   
   - `Shape` is an abstract class with an abstract method `area`.
   - It has a private `name` field, demonstrating encapsulation. The `getName` method provides access to the name attribute.

2. **Modularity and Code Reusability (Circle and Square classes):**
   
   - `Circle` and `Square` are concrete classes that extend the abstract class `Shape`.
   - They provide their own implementations of the `area` method.
   - The constructors use `super(name)` to call the constructor of the base class, demonstrating code reuse.

3. **Polymorphism (ShapePrinter class):**
   
   - The `ShapePrinter` class has a static method `printArea` that takes a `Shape` object as a parameter and prints its area.
   - This demonstrates polymorphism, as the same method can be used for different shapes.

4. **Framework Development (Main class):**
   
   - The `main` method in the `Main` class creates instances of different shapes using the common `Shape` interface.
   - It then uses the `ShapePrinter` to print the areas of these shapes, demonstrating framework development and polymorphism.

This Java example mirrors the Python example but provides a more detailed explanation and additional code snippets to help illustrate each concept.

# Interface

![](assets/2024-01-05-20-37-37-image.png)

- Interface defines the specifications or contract on how a class should act.

- A subclass can not have two superclasses in java. It can only be done through interface. 

- So, we say you cannot use multiple inheritance with classes in java - a child cannot have two parent or two base classes in java. It is also called the diamond problem because the child class does not know whether to follow the route of base-1 class or the base-2 class.

- To solve it, we need interfaces.

# Interface - why?: Java has Map interface

- For example, in Java we have Map or Set as interface, why? in order to enforce or ensure that the implemented classes must follow the same structure defined in the interface. So, the HashSet, LinkedHashSet or TreeSet, these classes that implements the Set interface, must follow the structure and need to have the functionalities defined in the Set interface.

# why Java chose to use interface instead of abstract classes for Map or Set

Great question! The choice between using an interface or an abstract class in Java depends on the design requirements. Here are some reasons why `Map` and `Set` are interfaces instead of abstract classes:

1. **Multiple Inheritance**: Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes, which means a class can only extend one other class. However, a class can implement multiple interfaces. If `Map` and `Set` were abstract classes, a class like `HashMap` or `HashSet` wouldn‚Äôt be able to extend any other class.

2. **Flexibility**: Interfaces are more flexible because they allow classes to implement the methods in any way they choose, as long as they adhere to the method signatures. Abstract classes can provide a default implementation that may not be suitable for all subclasses.

3. **Design Principle**: Interfaces are a key part of the design principle ‚Äúprogram to an interface, not an implementation.‚Äù This principle encourages you to write code that depends on abstract types (interfaces), not concrete types (classes). This makes your code more flexible and easier to change.

Here‚Äôs an example to illustrate these points:

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

// A class can implement multiple interfaces
class Bird implements Flyable, Eatable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bird is flying");
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Bird is eating");
    }
}

// If Flyable and Eatable were abstract classes, this wouldn't be possible
// because a class can only extend one other class in Java.
```

In this example, `Bird` can implement both `Flyable` and `Eatable` because they are interfaces. If they were abstract classes, `Bird` could only extend one of them.

# Polymorphism

* Interface allows us to achieve Polymorphism.
* Polymorphism is a concept where we achieve different functionalities with a common code structure. For example, Interface allows us to achieve Polymorphism. What do we do in interface? We declare abstract methods in an interface and several other classes may implement that interface to override the methods. Here we see that same method, we achieve different functionalities in different classes based on implementation.
* Also, with Inheritance, we achieve similar results as we override the methods of the  super class in the base class as needed.
* Sometimes, we need to call same methods with different parameters - which we know as method overloading also achieves different functionalities with common code.
* Also, when we need to add two numbers, we use the + operator. And when we need to concatenate two strings, we also use + operator. - This is also another example where we achieve different functionalities with + operator in different scenarios.

**Interface allows us to achieve Polymorphism. - How?**

When we use interface, we declare abstract methods in it as necessary and when we implement that interface with different classes, we must override those abstract methods in the interface, achieving different functionalities as per our implementation.

# What's the difference between an abstract class and interface?

1. We can't inherit multiple parent class for a single subclass, but we can do that for interfaces

2. if we declare any fields in an interface, it will be of static final and so we need to initialize it like this `int age = 20` `String name = 'Karim'

3. Also, In abstract classes we can declare non abstract methods but in interfaces, we can only declare abstract methods, default methods or static methods.

4. **When Abstract Class:** When we have lots of subclasses having the same functionalities and same types of fields. (having "is a" relationship)

5. **When Interface:** When we have lots of unrelated classes want to do a certain thing, we can declare that method in an interface and these classes can then implement the interface to override that method to do that certain thing.

# Example of a class which implements multiple interface and extends from a super class

```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}

// First interface
interface Walks {
    void walk();
}

// Second interface
interface Swims {
    void swim();
}

// Class implementing multiple interfaces and extending a superclass
class Dog extends Animal implements Walks, Swims {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark! Bark!");
    }

    @Override
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Dog is walking");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Dog is swimming");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of Dog
        Dog myDog = new Dog();

        // Call methods from the superclass and interfaces
        myDog.makeSound();
        myDog.walk();
        myDog.swim();
    }
}
```

# Upcasting and Downcasting in java

```java
class Animal { }
class Dog extends Animal { }

// Upcasting
Animal animal = new Dog();

// Downcasting
Dog dog = (Dog) animal; // Explicit downcasting (downcating the dog object)
Dog dog = new Animal(); // Implicit downcasting generates compiler error!
```

### Upcasting

- In below code, I can't use the Child class methods because the child class Manager is upcasted to Employee class:

```java
package com.nayemtech;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       Employee nazrul = new Manager(30);

        System.out.println(nazrul.getAge()); //Error can not access getAge method of the child class Manager
    }
} 


package com.nayemtech;

public class Employee {
    private String name;

    public Employee() {
    }

    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
} 

package com.nayemtech;

public class Manager extends Employee {
    private int age;

    public Manager(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

### Donwcasting

- and this is downcasting:

```java
package com.nayemtech;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       Employee employee = new Employee(); //need to declare it first then downcast the object employee, not the class

        Employee nazrul = (Manager)employee; //implicit downcasting

       System.out.println(nazrul.getName());

    }
}
```

Sure, here‚Äôs the full code with an anonymous class that overrides the `startEngine` method in the `Vehicle` abstract class:

```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Vehicle {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    public abstract void startEngine();
}

// Subclass for Car
class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("The car's engine starts with a key.");
    }
}

// Subclass for Motorcycle
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("The motorcycle's engine starts with a button.");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Car object
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.startEngine();  // Outputs "The car's engine starts with a key."

        // Create a Motorcycle object
        Motorcycle myMotorcycle = new Motorcycle();
        myMotorcycle.startEngine();  // Outputs "The motorcycle's engine starts with a button."

        // Create an anonymous class that overrides the startEngine method
        Vehicle myVehicle = new Vehicle() {
            @Override
            public void startEngine() {
                System.out.println("The vehicle starts with a remote control.");
            }
        };
        myVehicle.startEngine();  // Outputs "The vehicle starts with a remote control."
    }
}
```

In this code, `myVehicle` is an instance of an anonymous subclass of `Vehicle`. The `startEngine` method is overridden in this anonymous subclass. When `myVehicle.startEngine()` is called, it will print ‚ÄúThe vehicle starts with a remote control.‚Äù This demonstrates how you can use an anonymous class to override a method without explicitly declaring a new named subclass. Let me know if you have any other questions! üòä
