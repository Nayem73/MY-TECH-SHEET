# Linked List

### Advantages:

1. lots of insertions and deletions

2. combining linked lists: a linked list with huge amounts of nodes can be added to another large linked list with only O(1) time complexity (in constant time)

3. same as above, splitting and creatng many separate linked list in constant time.



### Disadvantage:

1. can not access elements in middle of the list in constant time (can not access by index like arrays)

2. takes more memory as it needs to add the next pointers along with the value
