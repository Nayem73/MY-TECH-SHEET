Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Java Developer position at your company. I recently earned a B.Sc. Engg. in Computer Science and Engineering from Pabna University of Science and Technology. As a fresh graduate, I have gained experience in developing web applications using Spring Boot and other technologies during my university years.

As a Java Developer, I have successfully developed and delivered several projects using Spring Boot, such as AI-Farming, BPL Dashboard, Rent Anything, and Student Dashboard. These projects demonstrate my skills in creating REST APIs, integrating AI models, implementing payment gateways, utilizing various databases, conducting tests with JUnit, and deploying with Docker and Kubernetes. I have also collaborated with team members using Git and GitHub for version control and code review.

I am proud to share that I secured the 4th place in a recent National Hackathon, where I used Spring Boot as the backend in a 24-hour, non-stop contest under pressure. Moreover, my team was among the top 10 finalists in Therap Javafest 2023. These achievements are a testament to my aptitude and capabilities to contribute significantly to any Java-based project.

My success can be attributed to my extensive problem-solving experience gained through participation in various online and onsite programming contests during my university years. I have honed my skills in implementing different data structures and algorithms, which have solidified my programming foundation and enhanced my problem-solving skills and ability to work under pressure.

I am proficient in Java and C++. I am eager to learn new technologies and further improve my skills in Java and Spring Boot to deliver quality products.

I am confident that I can be a valuable asset to your team and contribute to the success of your projects. I would love to discuss this opportunity with you in more detail. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to see some samples of my work.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Nayem Mehedi
