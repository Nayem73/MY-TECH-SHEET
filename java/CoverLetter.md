Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer (Intern) position at your company. I recently earned a B.Sc. Engg. in Computer Science and Engineering from Pabna University of Science and Technology. As a fresh graduate, I have gained experience in developing web applications using Spring Boot and other technologies during my university years.

As a Backend Developer, I have successfully developed and delivered several projects using Spring Boot, such as AI-Farming, Smart Village, BPL Dashboard and Rent Anything. These projects demonstrate my skills in creating REST APIs, integrating AI models, implementing payment gateways and utilizing databases properly. I have also collaborated with team members using Git and GitHub for version control, code review, and collaboration.

I am proud to share that I secured the 4th place in a recent National Hackathon, where I used Spring Boot as the backend in a 24-hour, non-stop contest under pressure. Moreover, my team was among the top 10 finalists in Therap Javafest 2023. These achievements are a testament to my aptitude and capabilities to contribute significantly to any software project using various technologies.

My success can be attributed to my extensive problem-solving experience gained through participation in various online and onsite programming contests during my university years. I have honed my skills in implementing different data structures and algorithms, which have solidified my programming foundation and enhanced my problem-solving skills and ability to work under pressure.

I am proficient in Java and C++. I am eager to learn new technologies and further improve my skills in Java and Spring Boot to deliver quality products.

I am confident that I can be a valuable asset to your team and contribute to the success of your projects. I've attached my resume for your review. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,  
Nayem Mehedi
