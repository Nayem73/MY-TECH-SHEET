# Structured Programming Vs Object Oriented Programming

- In structured programming, we divide it into smaller functions and we execute them in a specific order. Each of these functions perform their own specific tasks. For example, in C, we have a main function and users can create other user-defined functions. From the main function, we call the other functions. When we call other functions, the control is passed to that function. After executing the tasks in the current function, the control goes back to the main function and so on. MoreOver, a variable inside a function is local variable and global variables are accessible by all the functions.

- In Object Oriented Programming, we represent real world scenario using class and creating objects of the class, where class is the blueprint for creating objects. Class is an entity that has attributes and behaviors, we call them as fields and methods.

- Unlike structured programming, where we divide the enire program into functions, with oop, we start with small parts - objects and build up the entire program.

- interview question: what are the benefits of Object Oriented Programming?

# Sure, here are some key benefits of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

1. **Modularity for easier troubleshooting**: When working with OOP languages, you know exactly where to look when something goes wrong. [Objects are self-contained, and each bit of functionality does its own thing while leaving the other bits alone](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/career-development/4-advantages-of-object-oriented-programming)[1](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/career-development/4-advantages-of-object-oriented-programming).

2. [**Reuse of code through inheritance**: Inheritance allows developers to create new objects that inherit properties of existing objects, reducing redundancy and improving code maintainability](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/career-development/4-advantages-of-object-oriented-programming)[1](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/career-development/4-advantages-of-object-oriented-programming).

3. [**Flexibility through polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects to take on many forms, increasing flexibility in how objects can be used](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/career-development/4-advantages-of-object-oriented-programming)[1](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/career-development/4-advantages-of-object-oriented-programming).

4. **Effective problem solving**: OOP offers a whole new way of solving problems. With OOP, instead of writing a program, you create classes. [A class contains both data and functions](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/career-development/4-advantages-of-object-oriented-programming)[1](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/career-development/4-advantages-of-object-oriented-programming).

5. [**Data hiding**: The principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs which cannot be invaded by the code in other parts of the program](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/benefits-advantages-of-oop/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/benefits-advantages-of-oop/).

6. **Code reusability**: It means reusing some facilities rather than building them again and again. [This is done with the use of a class](https://www.educba.com/advantages-of-oop/)[3](https://www.educba.com/advantages-of-oop/).

Remember, while OOP offers many advantages, itâ€™s not suitable for all types of problems. [The thought process involved in OOP may not be natural for some people, and everything is treated as an object in OOP, so before applying it, we need to have excellent thinking in terms of objects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/benefits-advantages-of-oop/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/benefits-advantages-of-oop/).
