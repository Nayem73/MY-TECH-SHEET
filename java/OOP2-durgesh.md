# What is OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming method that uses the concept of ‚Äúobjects‚Äù to design software. Objects are instances of classes, which are like blueprints. [Each object can have unique values for the properties defined in the class](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)[1](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). Here are some key points you can mention during an interview:

1. **Definition**: OOP is a paradigm where the complete software operates as a bunch of objects talking to each other. [An object is a collection of data and the methods which operate on that data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

2. **Advantages**: OOP provides better manageable code. It increases the overall understanding of the software as the distance between the language spoken by developers and that spoken by users is reduced. [It also eases maintenance by the use of encapsulation](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

3. **Class**: A class is a user-defined data type that contains the data members and member functions that operate on the data members. [It is like a blueprint or template of objects having common properties and methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

4. **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. Data members and methods of a class cannot be used directly. [We need to create an object (or instance) of the class to use them](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

5. [**Main Features**: The four main concepts or principles of OOPs are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oops-interview-questions/).

Remember, it‚Äôs important to provide examples when explaining these concepts to demonstrate your practical understanding of OOP. Good luck with your interview! üòä

<u>**by Me:**</u> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming method that uses the concept of ‚Äúobjects‚Äù. Now, what is object? Objects are instances of classes, We know classes as the blueprints from which we can create multiple objects.
