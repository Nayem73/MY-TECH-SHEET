# look for job in this order:

There's a paradox in the job search process.  

Companies typically look for candidates in this order:  

⮑ Advertise internally, and promote people internally  
⮑ Referrals from employees  
⮑ Networking  
⮑ Recruiters  
⮑ Job boards  

They might advertise on job boards at the start, but they'll prioritise candidates from other sources before looking at applications.  

Paradoxically, candidates typically apply for jobs like this:  

⮑ Job boards  
⮑ Recruiters  
⮑ Networking  
⮑ Seeking out referrals  

The best way to stand out as a candidate is to prioritise building relationships and networking, alongside applying for jobs. Meet the hiring managers in the middle.
