### I've created a branch bjet-79-change-password-frontend and I pushed my work there Now I want to merge my work in the main branch but found that I'm 3 commits ahead, 2 commits behind

To merge your branch `bjet-79-change-password-frontend` into the `main` branch while resolving the fact that you are 3 commits ahead and 2 commits behind, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Update your local main branch:**
   Ensure your local `main` branch is up to date with the remote `main` branch.
   
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Rebase your branch with the updated main branch:**
   Switch back to your feature branch and rebase it onto the updated `main` branch.
   
   ```sh
   git checkout bjet-79-change-password-frontend
   git rebase main
   ```
   
   During the rebase, you may encounter conflicts. If so, resolve them as they appear, then continue the rebase.
   
   ```sh
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   ```

3. **Push the rebased branch to the remote repository:**
   Once the rebase is complete, you need to force-push the updated branch to the remote repository. This is necessary because the rebase

changes the commit history.

```sh
git push origin bjet-79-change-password-frontend --force
```

4. **Merge the feature branch into the main branch:**
   After pushing your changes, switch back to the `main` branch and merge your feature branch.
   
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git merge bjet-79-change-password-frontend
   ```

5. **Push the updated main branch to the remote repository:**
   Finally, push the merged changes to the remote `main` branch.
   
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

### Summary of Commands

```sh
# Step 1: Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Step 2: Rebase your feature branch with the updated main branch
git checkout bjet-79-change-password-frontend
git rebase main

# Resolve conflicts if any, then continue the rebase
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Step 3: Push the rebased branch to the remote repository
git push origin bjet-79-change-password-frontend --force

# Step 4: Merge the feature branch into the main branch
git checkout main
git merge bjet-79-change-password-frontend

# Step 5: Push the updated main branch to the remote repository
git push origin main
```

### Handling Conflicts

During the rebase process, if you encounter conflicts, Git will pause and give you the opportunity to resolve them. Follow these steps:

1. Identify and resolve conflicts in the files listed by Git.
2. After resolving conflicts, mark them as resolved using `git add <file>`.
3. Continue the rebase with `git rebase --continue`.
4. Repeat the process if there are more conflicts until the rebase completes.

By following these steps, you ensure that your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the `main` branch, and your work is successfully integrated without losing any commits.

### once I update my local main branch, and then checkout to bjet-79-change-password-frontend then, shouldn't I do git pull main instead of git rebase main?

Using `git pull main` instead of `git rebase main` is an option, but it works differently. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison and explanation:

### Using `git pull main`

When you use `git pull` on your feature branch, it performs a fetch and then a merge. This means it will bring in the latest changes from the `main` branch and merge them into your feature branch, creating a merge commit if there are any changes.

```sh
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Switch to your feature branch
git checkout bjet-79-change-password-frontend

# Pull changes from main and merge
git pull origin main
```

### Using `git rebase main`

When you use `git rebase main`, it replays your feature branch commits onto the top of the `main` branch. This creates a cleaner commit history because it avoids unnecessary merge commits and keeps a linear history.

```sh
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Switch to your feature branch
git checkout bjet-79-change-password-frontend

# Rebase onto main
git rebase main
```

### Key Differences

- **Merge (`git pull origin main`):**
  
  - Creates a merge commit if there are changes in both branches.
  - History includes all commits from both branches, including merge commits.
  - Easier if you want to preserve the exact history and context of how changes were integrated.

- **Rebase (`git rebase main`):**
  
  - Re-applies your commits on top of the `main` branch.
  - Creates a linear, cleaner history without merge commits.
  - Can be more complex if there are conflicts, as it requires resolving conflicts for each commit being rebased.

### Recommended Steps

For a cleaner commit history, I recommend using `rebase`, but if you prefer the simplicity of merge commits or if your team prefers this workflow, you can use `git pull`. Here's the revised guide for both methods:

#### Using `git rebase`

1. **Update your local main branch:**
   
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Rebase your feature branch onto the updated main branch:**
   
   ```sh
   git checkout bjet-79-change-password-frontend
   git rebase main
   ```

3. **Resolve any conflicts if they arise:**
   
   ```sh
   # Resolve conflicts
   git add <resolved-file>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. **Push the rebased branch to the remote repository:**
   
   ```sh
   git push origin bjet-79-change-password-frontend --force
   ```

5. **Merge the feature branch into the main branch:**
   
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git merge bjet-79-change-password-frontend
   ```

6. **Push the updated main branch to the remote repository:**
   
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

#### Using `git pull`

1. **Update your local main branch:**
   
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Merge the changes from the main branch into your feature branch:**
   
   ```sh
   git checkout bjet-79-change-password-frontend
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Resolve any conflicts if they arise:**
   
   ```sh
   # Resolve conflicts
   git add <resolved-file>
   git commit
   ```

4. **Push the feature branch to the remote repository:**
   
   ```sh
   git push origin bjet-79-change-password-frontend
   ```

5. **Merge the feature branch into the main branch:**
   
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git merge bjet-79-change-password-frontend
   ```

6. **Push the updated main branch to the remote repository:**
   
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

### Conclusion

Both methods are valid, and the choice depends on your preferred workflow and your team's practices. Using `rebase` keeps the history cleaner, while `merge` is more straightforward and preserves the original context of changes.
