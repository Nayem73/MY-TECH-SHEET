# ACID

ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

### Example of a database transaction:

Sure, let’s consider a banking system. Suppose you want to transfer money from your savings account to your checking account.

Here’s how it might look as a transaction:

1. **Step 1**: The system checks if your savings account has enough money for the transfer.
2. **Step 2**: If there’s enough money, the system subtracts the transfer amount from your savings account.
3. **Step 3**: The system adds the transfer amount to your checking account.

This entire operation, consisting of these three steps, is a single transaction. It’s important that all three steps complete successfully. If there’s a problem at any step (like if there’s not enough money in the savings account, or if there’s a system error while updating the checking account), the entire transaction should fail, and any changes made during the transaction (like the money subtracted from the savings account) should be undone. This is the concept of atomicity in ACID.

This is a simple example, but real-world database transactions can be much more complex, involving multiple operations on multiple tables or databases. But the basic idea is the same: a transaction is a group of operations that are performed as a single unit of work.

### Example of a simplified database transaction:

A database transaction is like a shopping trip to the supermarket. Let’s say you want to make a sandwich, so you need to buy bread, cheese, and ham.

In database terms, buying each item can be seen as an operation. The whole shopping trip, which includes all three operations, is a transaction.

So, if everything goes well, you’ll end up with all the items you need for your sandwich (the transaction is successful). But if the supermarket is out of ham, you might decide not to buy anything at all (the transaction is unsuccessful, and you roll back the operations).

In a database, a transaction might involve reading from and writing to multiple tables. Just like the shopping trip, either all the operations are successful, or none of them are. This ensures the database stays consistent and accurate.

1. **Atomicity**: This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work, which either completes entirely or not at all. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged.

2. **Consistency**: This means that the database must always follow its own rules. If a transaction would break these rules, it’s not allowed to happen. For example, if a rule says that an account balance can’t be negative, a transaction that would make it negative is not allowed.

3. **Isolation**: This property ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state as if the transactions were executed sequentially. In other words, the execution of one transaction is isolated from others.
-  Imagine two transactions happening at the same time. Isolation means that each one is done as if the other one isn’t happening. They don’t interfere with each other. For example, if two people are buying the last ticket at the same time, isolation ensures that only one of them can buy it.
4. **Durability**: This property ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure. This is typically achieved by storing transaction logs in non-volatile storage.
- This means that once a transaction is done, it’s done for good and can’t be undone, even if something like a power outage happens right after. For example, once the money is transferred to another account, it stays there even if the bank’s computers crash right after.

Sure, let’s break down the ACID properties using the bank transaction example:

1. **Atomicity**: This means that all steps of the transaction happen completely or not at all. In our example, if any step of the money transfer fails (like if there’s not enough money in the savings account, or if there’s a system error while updating the checking account), the entire transaction should fail. No money should be subtracted from the savings account unless it can be added to the checking account.

2. **Consistency**: This ensures that the transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining the integrity of the data. In our example, consistency ensures that the total amount of money in the savings and checking accounts remains the same before and after the transaction.

3. **Isolation**: This means that multiple transactions happening at the same time won’t affect each other. For example, even if two people are trying to withdraw money from the same account at the same time, each transaction would be processed separately, ensuring that each sees a “snapshot” of the account balance that’s unaffected by the other transaction.

4. **Durability**: This ensures that once a transaction is completed, it will remain so, even in the event of a power loss, crash, or other error. In our example, once the money transfer is completed, the changes to the savings and checking accounts will be saved and will persist even if the system crashes immediately after.

So, in simple terms, ACID ensures that each transaction is processed completely and correctly, even when multiple transactions are happening at the same time, and that once a transaction is done, it’s permanent.

In SQL, DDL, DML, DQL, and DCL are acronyms that represent different types of operations you can perform on a database:

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: These are commands that define the structure of a database, like creating, altering, or deleting tables. [Examples are `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-dql-ddl-dml-in-sql/)[1](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-dql-ddl-dml-in-sql/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/).

2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: These are commands that manipulate the data in a database, like inserting, updating, or deleting data. [Examples are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-dql-ddl-dml-in-sql/)[1](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-dql-ddl-dml-in-sql/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/).

3. **DQL (Data Query Language)**: This is used to query data from a database. [The primary example is the `SELECT` command, which retrieves data](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-dql-ddl-dml-in-sql/)[1](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-dql-ddl-dml-in-sql/)[3](https://database.guide/what-is-dql/).

4. **DCL (Data Control Language)**: These are commands that control access to the database, like granting or revoking permissions. [Examples are `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, and `DENY`](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-dql-ddl-dml-in-sql/)[1](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-dql-ddl-dml-in-sql/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/).

Each of these groups of commands allows you to interact with a database in different ways, and they’re all important parts of SQL.

# in an ecommerce site, when ther's only one item left and 2 users orders it at the same time, how does the database acid property handle it?

[In an e-commerce site, when there’s only one item left and two users order it at the same time, the database’s ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties play a crucial role in handling this situation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/)[2](https://airbyte.com/data-engineering-resources/transactional-databases-explained-acid-properties-and-best-practice).

Here’s how each property helps:

1. [**Atomicity**: This property ensures that a transaction (an order in this case) is treated as a single, indivisible unit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/). That means either the entire transaction is completed, or none of it is. [If a transaction fails at any point, all changes are rolled back, and the database remains unchanged](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/). So, if two users try to order the last item simultaneously, only one transaction will be completed, and the other will be rolled back.

2. [**Consistency**: This property ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/). In this context, it means that the number of items in stock can’t go below zero. If two users try to order the last item at the same time, the consistency property will ensure that the item count doesn’t go negative.

3. [**Isolation**: This property ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/). So, even if two users place an order for the last item at the same time, the database handles them as if they were placed one after the other.

4. [**Durability**: This property ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/)[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/). This means that once an order is successfully placed, it’s final and will persist, even if the system crashes immediately afterward.

So, in the scenario you described, the ACID properties of the database ensure that only one user can successfully order the last item. The other user’s transaction will not be completed, and they would typically receive a message indicating that the item is no longer available.



# Keys

Sure, I can explain the difference between a unique key and other types of keys in a database. Here are some common types of keys:

1. **Unique Key**: A unique key is a set of one or more fields/columns of a table that uniquely identify a record in a database table. You can say that it is little like a primary key but it can accept only one null value and it cannot have duplicate values.

2. **Primary Key**: A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table. Primary keys must contain unique values. A primary key column cannot have NULL values. A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of single or multiple fields.

3. **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table, that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables. It is a field in a table that is a primary key in another table. A foreign key can accept multiple null, duplicate values.

4. **Candidate Key**: A candidate key is a set of one or more fields/columns that can identify a record uniquely in a table. There can be multiple candidate keys in a table. Each candidate key can work as a primary key, to uniquely identify each record in a table.

5. **Composite Key**: A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table when the columns are combined uniqueness is guaranteed, but when taken individually the columns do not guarantee uniqueness.

6. **Secondary Key**: A secondary key is a non-unique field that can be used for data retrieval. This key does not provide uniqueness, but allows for fast access to data when the primary key is not known.

So, the main difference between a unique key and other types of keys is that a unique key allows for null values (although only one), and it cannot have duplicate values. Other keys have different properties and constraints. For example, a primary key does not allow nulls and must be unique, a foreign key is used to link two tables, and so on.
