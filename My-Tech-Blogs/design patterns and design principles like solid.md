- when the interviewer asks me, do you know about design patterns? Can I answer it like this?
  "Yes. Design Patterns are elegant solutions for repeating problems in software design. I know about the Singleton design pattern, dependency injection, which is also referred as a design pattern, and I know about the SOLID principles which is the first 5 design principles in object oriented programming."

Yes, your answer is a good start. It shows that you understand what design patterns are and you have knowledge of some common ones. However, you could make your answer more impactful by providing examples of when and why you would use these patterns. Here‚Äôs an example:

"Yes, I am familiar with Design Patterns. They are proven solutions to common problems we encounter in software design. For instance, the Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This can be useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, like a database connection.

Dependency Injection, another pattern I‚Äôve used, allows us to remove hard-coded dependencies and make our application loosely coupled, extendable, and maintainable. We can implement dependency injection to move the hard-coded dependencies to somewhere else in the program, so the code becomes easier to test and manage.

Lastly, I also follow the SOLID principles in Object-Oriented Programming to make the software design more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. For example, the Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. This principle gives us the benefit of making our software easier to understand and helps in reducing the impact of change.

In my past projects, I have applied these patterns and principles to effectively solve design problems and I am eager to delve deeper into them in future projects."

Remember, the key is to show your understanding and practical application of these concepts. Good luck with your interview! üòä

Sure, I‚Äôd be happy to explain that with an example.

In software design, ‚Äúloosely coupled‚Äù means that the components of the system are independent and have little knowledge of each other. This makes them easier to change and less likely to cause problems in other parts of the system when they do change.

Let‚Äôs consider a simple example of a `Car` class and an `Engine` class in a tightly coupled system:

```java
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        // Start the engine
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine();

    public void start() {
        engine.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class is tightly coupled to the `Engine` class because it directly instantiates an `Engine` object. If we want to use a different type of engine, we would have to modify the `Car` class.

Now, let‚Äôs make this system loosely coupled using dependency injection:

```java
interface Engine {
    void start();
}

class GasEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        // Start the gas engine
    }
}

class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        // Start the electric engine
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void start() {
        engine.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class is now loosely coupled to the `Engine` interface. We can easily switch between a `GasEngine` and an `ElectricEngine` without modifying the `Car` class. We simply pass the specific engine we want to use when we create a new `Car` object:

```java
Engine gasEngine = new GasEngine();
Car car1 = new Car(gasEngine);

Engine electricEngine = new ElectricEngine();
Car car2 = new Car(electricEngine);
```

This is the essence of loose coupling - making our components more flexible, interchangeable, and easier to test and maintain. I hope this helps! üòä
