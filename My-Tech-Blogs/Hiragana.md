Yes, it’s perfectly fine to say “以上です” (Ijō desu) at the end of your presentation. This phrase is commonly used in Japan to indicate that you have finished your talk or presentation. It translates to “That’s all” or “That’s the end”. However, it’s always a good idea to thank your audience for their time and attention. You could say something like “以上です。聞いていただきありがとうございました” (Ijō desu. Kiite itadaki arigatōgozaimashita), which means “That’s all. Thank you for listening”. Good luck! 😊

Sure, here are some examples of Japanese business etiquette and work culture:

**Business Etiquette**:

1. **Silence Is Golden**: In a business setting, silence is valued over an overabundance of talking. Silence speaks loudly about wisdom and emotional self-control[1](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/doing-business-in-japan-10-etiquette-rules-you-should-know/)[1](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/doing-business-in-japan-10-etiquette-rules-you-should-know/).
2. **Group Solidarity Is Paramount**: Japan is a group-oriented culture—group solidarity can often be valued over individualism[1](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/doing-business-in-japan-10-etiquette-rules-you-should-know/)[1](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/doing-business-in-japan-10-etiquette-rules-you-should-know/).
3. **First Impressions Matter**: The first impression matters. In fact, in Japanese business etiquette, it’s not only the first impression — it’s also every other impression[2](https://www.nihongomaster.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-japanese-business-etiquette)[2](https://www.nihongomaster.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-japanese-business-etiquette).
4. **Handling Business Cards**: Business cards should be handled with care and respect. When receiving a business card, take a moment to read it before putting it away[3](https://www.ejable.com/japan-corner/working-in-japan/japanese-business-etiquette/)[3](https://www.ejable.com/japan-corner/working-in-japan/japanese-business-etiquette/).
5. **Dress Conservatively**: When it comes to business attire, conservative dress is the norm. Stick to dark colors, avoiding bold patterns or excessive accessories[4](https://dorado-group.jp/blog/japanese-business-etiquette-the-dos-and-donts)[4](https://dorado-group.jp/blog/japanese-business-etiquette-the-dos-and-donts).

**Work Culture**:

1. **Core Values**: Work culture in Japan is based on an intense commitment, ethics, and extreme dedication to the company and the work with an extremely high sense of responsibility[5](https://www.ejable.com/japan-corner/working-in-japan/japanese-work-culture/)[5](https://www.ejable.com/japan-corner/working-in-japan/japanese-work-culture/).
2. **Collectivist Culture**: While the Western work culture is more individualistic, the Japanese work culture is collectivist[5](https://www.ejable.com/japan-corner/working-in-japan/japanese-work-culture/)[5](https://www.ejable.com/japan-corner/working-in-japan/japanese-work-culture/).
3. **Long Working Hours**: One notable aspect of Japanese work culture is the long working hours[6](https://dorado-group.jp/blog/understanding-japanese-work-culture)[8](https://dorado-group.jp/blog/understanding-japanese-work-culture).
4. **Punctuality and Dedication**: Timeliness is highly valued in Japan. Arrive a few minutes early to meetings and appointments as a sign of respect for others’ time[7](https://nnroad.com/blog/japanese-work-culture/)[7](https://nnroad.com/blog/japanese-work-culture/).
5. **Group Harmony**: Japanese business culture heavily favors group harmony over individual satisfaction[8](https://globisinsights.com/purpose/values/japanese-working-culture/)[6](https://globisinsights.com/purpose/values/japanese-working-culture/).

These are just a few examples. It’s important to remember that customs can vary depending on the region and the situation. When visiting Japan, it’s a good idea to observe and follow the local customs as closely as possible. [It’s also appreciated when foreigners make an effort to understand and respect Japanese customs and traditions](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/doing-business-in-japan-10-etiquette-rules-you-should-know/)[1](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/doing-business-in-japan-10-etiquette-rules-you-should-know/)[1][2](https://www.nihongomaster.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-japanese-business-etiquette)[2](https://www.nihongomaster.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-japanese-business-etiquette).
