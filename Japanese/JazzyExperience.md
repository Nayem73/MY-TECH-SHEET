How I got 180/180 on N1 in ~8.5 Months!

 

[Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22&restrict_sr=1)

Hi everyone! My name is Jazzy and as the title suggests - I took the JLPT N1 in December



2021, got my result back earlier this week and was pleasantly surprised to find that I'd gottena full score of 180/180! I started learning Japanese from 0 on March 18th 2021, and in just



over 8.5 months I managed to get to a point where I was able to get full marks on the N1without doing any specific JLPT study and without having ever been to Japan - byconsistently immersing in native content that interested me.

Especially from people who weren't there to see my progress from the beginning, I've received a lotof questions about what I did at different stages of my journey as well as advice/a reflection on whatworked well and what didn't. Also, really happy about how well the test went and I felt this wouldbe a good opportunity to reflect on my journey thus far. Hence the purpose of this post. Pretty newto Reddit but I felt this platform would be a good way to reach more people - hopefully you findsomething useful in this post. ^_^

Side note:

 just as an aside because sometimes I also get people asking me about this, I do not knowChinese or Korean and Japanese is the first language I've tried to learn. A bit more about mybackground, I've lived in the UK my entire life and my native language is English, althoughethnically I'm Pakistani so I can speak a little bit of Urdu and my listening is also decent (but Icannot read or write it) as a result of family.

Why and How I started learning Japanese:

As I'm sure is the case for many others, I had a lot more free time opened up as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Alongside my university degree (currently a Physics undergrad student ), some of

the activities that usually took up a lot of my time were training (as I'm an amateur boxer) 5 times aweek, and taking part in/holding various events as a committee member of different societies at myuniversity. Due to various quarantines and lockdowns I was unable to do either of these for quite awhile and also found myself indoors a lot more often due to not being able to go out with friends asfrequently.In addition, when I was younger I used to read a lot and I've always loved a good story but duringhigh school and while at uni I haven't done much reading for pleasure at all. Thus I figured it wouldbe a cool idea to learn a language and read enjoyable material in that language, as a fun and

productive way to use the extra time I'd gained. As someone who used to watch anime/read mangawhen they were younger, Japanese was the obvious choice for me.I spent a couple of days researching different language learning methods until coming across theAJATT website. Upon reading through it, the idea of learning a language by immersing withcontent I enjoy sounded very attractive to me and is also something I realised I'm already familiarwith. In my household I've always grown up speaking English to my parents but they speak a mixof Urdu and English to me, however, despite hardly ever using the language otherwise, when Ivisited relatives in Pakistan once every few years I found I was able to hold basic conversationswith a pretty good accent purely because of the listening input I'd received from my parents.Therefore, it definitely didn't seem like a far-fetched concept to me however the idea of sacrificingall my time every day for Japanese was definitely not something I was going to do, but I decided to just have fun with it and try to immerse as much as I can alongside my main responsibilities (byusing my time efficiently). I came across many other websites/blogs talking about a similarimmersion-based learning approach and so decided to just get stuck in - marking the beginning ofmy Japanese learning journey on 18th March 2021.

First ~2.5 Months (18th March 2021 - 31st May 2021):

My first day was spent learning the hiragana and katakana - I did so by grinding an Anki deck foreach of them and also repeatedly writing out each character about 10 times. I then left it there anddecided I'd just hammer them in long term by seeing them in my immersion - quite the brute-forcemethod for sure but it got the job done lol. Next, I used a Core 2k vocab deck that I found on Ankito gain an initial base of vocab (examples of good decks are the[Core 2.3k Deck](https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/) and the Tangodecks). I continued the deck for 20 days doing 50 cards a day (which took me about 45 minutes aday at the time), dropping it after hitting 1000 cards at which point I decided to start mining (i.e.creating my own anki cards out of unknown vocab in my immersion material).Throughout these first ~2.5 months I was immersing using native content, right from day one. Atfirst it was largely through Japanese-subbed anime (tending to more slice-of-life style series which Istill found interesting, as they usually use more basic vocab) - of course, in the beginning I couldn'tunderstand much at all so it mostly just served the purpose of getting used to readinghiragana/katakana, getting used to listening to Japanese, hammering in the Core vocab I learntthrough Anki as well as being a source of new vocab (which I would pick up by stopping to look upwords every now and then as well as by being exposed to common words many times in differentcontexts).After the first couple of weeks I started diversifying my immersion sources - for listening I wasusing a whole range of native podcasts, youtube videos, audiobooks, dramas, reality TV, etc. Iwould look up a word if I heard it used a lot or it stuck out to me but otherwise I wouldn't pause and just focused to try and pick out as much as I could. One podcast I highly recommend is the[Sokoani](https://sokoani.com/)[podcast](https://sokoani.com/), a series which discusses different anime shows - I found this useful because by watchingthe podcast episodes for anime I had already seen I would have more context as to what they'retalking about and would be able to pick out more. A youtube channel that I also really liked was[NO](https://www.youtube.com/c/NOGOODTVOFFICIAL)[GOOD TV](https://www.youtube.com/c/NOGOODTVOFFICIAL), a podcast-type channel hosted by

錦戸亮

and

赤西仁

where they do a bunch of differentthings and have natural conversations on random topics (they also get guests on there often) - butoverall there were a broad range of different channels I watched from.

As for reading immersion I started reading a lot of manga, initially going for more slice-of-lifeseries and manga that used furigana before branching out into other series - I found manga andsubbed anime to be a great gateway into reading because the visual aspect gives you more contextto understand what's going on and the heavy inclination towards dialogue over narration means thesentences you encounter are usually simpler as opposed to a novel. I was still watching anime but Istarted splitting my anime immersion in to 2 different types. With half of the anime I watched Iwould use it for listening immersion by not using subs and rarely pausing to look stuff up. With theother half I would have Japanese subs on and would pause a lot more frequently to look up words Ididn't know, more so using it as reading immersion. During this period all the cards I mined on Ankiwere sentence cards (since the websites/blogs I'd come across usually recommended sentence cards)and I was repping between 30-40 new cards a day, which usually took around 40-50 minutes.For quite a while my comprehension was not that great and a big reason for that was grammar. Inever did any sort of grammar study and still have not to this day. I briefly watched 3 or 4 CureDolly youtube videos but quickly got bored and stopped. However, eventually just by seeingdifferent grammar patterns frequently in my immersion in different contexts I started being able tounderstand basic grammar patterns - slowly I started understanding much more of my immersion.Sure, perhaps I could've sped this up by going through a grammar guide like Tae Kim or the CureDolly videos but I enjoyed the route I took and even if I could do it all over again I wouldn't changeit.I've had questions regarding how to go about grammar study and my view is that I do think it can bea good idea to go through Tae Kim or Cure Dolly to prime yourself for seeing the grammar in yourimmersion, however, I personally don't think actually grinding grammar (e.g. by doing a grammardeck in Anki) is a very effective use of time as you won't truly understand what a grammar patternmeans/how it's used until you see it many times in context while immersing - will come on to this abit more in the next section. In terms of the immersion time I was putting in - from 18th March upto early May I was averaging about 3-4 hours a day (was usually skewed towards weekends soaround 2-3 hours on weekdays and then 5-6 hours on weekends), after which my uni summerholidays started and I did ~6-7 hours a day for the rest of May. That brings me to the end of the first(just under) 2.5 months.~

2.5 Months to ~5.5 Months (1st June 2021 - 31st August 2021):

The beginning of June marked a fairly significant turning point in my Japanese language journey. Idecided I wanted to give reading light novels and visual novels (will use the abbreviations 'LNs' and'VNs' from here on out) a try - I'd been wanting to read these in Japanese ever since I started andinitially I thought it would take me a long time to get good enough so I was holding off, but I gotsomewhat impatient and figured there's no harm in giving it a go. After looking it up I found ayoutube video that explained how to use a software called[Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor) coupled with a clipboardinserter and[Yomichan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami) to mine vocab from visual novels (note: Yomichan for those who don't knowis a browser extension that allows you to import multiple dictionaries and look up Japanese wordson your browser very easily as well as add them to Anki, it has a wealth of useful features and isone of the greatest tools available for Japanese learners). Unfortunately I could not find the exactvideo when I tried looking earlier but I am sure there are even better tutorials out there now. The

video skimmed over many of the details regarding setting up Yomichan so I tried looking further fora more comprehensive guide.This was when I came across the Resources page of[TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/) site which is, to this day, still oneof the most useful pages of Japanese learning resources I have found. In particular I came across[Stegatxins0's Mining Guide](https://rentry.co/mining) on it - a very comprehensive guide that explained in detail how toestablish a quick mining setup using Yomichan and Anki, as well as how to set up programs such asSharex to add screenshots/audio to your Anki cards. Additionally, I came across a linked site called[AnimeCards](https://animecards.site/) which contained a detailed Anki setup guide I used to replace the Anki settings I wasusing before; it also introduced the idea of using anime cards (essentially just high quality vocabcards) over sentence cards. At this point I started making anime cards too for some words but themajority of my Anki cards were still sentence cards. Furthermore, on the resources page Iencountered a great browser ebook reader -

[ッツ](https://ttu-ebook.web.app/)

 [](https://ttu-ebook.web.app/)

['s Ebook Reader](https://ttu-ebook.web.app/)

 [](https://ttu-ebook.web.app/)

, which I would use with Yomichan(and Kiwi Browser for when reading on my Android tablet) to read novels.At the same time, I joined TheMoeWay Discord server that was linked on the website. I hadn't usedDiscord much nor engaged with many online communities before I started learning Japanese so itwas definitely a new experience for me. There were multiple clubs in the server which I could useto discuss Japanese media such as VNs, novels, anime and manga with others (there's usually amonthly read that gets chosen in each of the clubs and it can be nice to read the same thing togetherand talk about it), and throughout my time at the server I've met a lot of great people. One feature inthe server that I found cool was the implementation of the Kotoba bot quizzes for discord roles -they usually involve correctly answering the reading for a certain number of words in a row. Thequizzes can be a somewhat decent indicator of where you're at with your vocab level (if you're notgrinding them) and served as a small source of extra motivation in trying to aim for higher roles.When I joined at the beginning of June I only managed to pass the Kotoba N5 quiz. Another featureI really liked was being able to log immersion times and the implementation of a monthlyimmersion leaderboard, which brought out my inner competitiveness during certain months.



There were a few other Japanese learning Discord communities I joined throughout my journey butTheMoeWay was the one I interacted with most.And so, with my mining setup sorted, I started reading my first LN and VN. It definitely wasn't easyat first - despite having a decent understanding of basic grammar from the first 2.5 months ofimmersing there were still a lot of new grammar points I was having to look up while reading (note:back to the topic in the last section on acquiring grammar, this is how I acquired pretty much all mygrammar knowledge from this point onwards - by looking up all grammar points I didn't understandwhile reading, using either yomichan or an online grammar reference such as DoJG and just beingexposed to them a lot in my immersion). Furthermore, I encountered a ton of new vocab that I hadnot seen before. As a result, I was reading at a very slow pace initially (around 3,000-4,000characters/hour) because there was a lot of vocab and grammar to look up, plus it often took me alittle while to think about a line before fully understanding it and moving on. However, personally Ihighly recommend this approach to reading of looking up everything you don't know and trying tounderstand as much as you can before moving on, since, while it may not be the most enjoyable atfirst, in the process you engage a lot more with the vocab you come across and also gain a betterappreciation of the role different grammar patterns you encounter are playing in a sentence. I canattest to the fact that putting in the effort early on and not cutting corners really does pay off. For

me, just the fact that I was learning so much new vocab I hadn't seen in my first 2.5 months oflearning was enjoyable in and of itself.Seeing more experienced people than me in the server who were able to read a lot more per dayreally motivated me (I also came across Doth's reddit post which was another great source ofmotivation). A few days later I managed to pass the Kotoba N4 quiz on the server, my vocab waspretty much there from the first 2.5 months of immersing but just a few days of reading was enoughto solidify it. Halfway through the month I ended up finishing my first LN, and a few days later Ialso finished my first VN. My reading speed at that point had grown to about 6,000 characters/hourfor the LN and 7,000 characters/hour for the VN due to the increased familiarity with reading and agrowth in vocab. Continuing on, I then started reading my 2nd LN (just the sequel to the first one Iread) as well as beginning my 2nd VN, one called Summer Pockets Reflection Blue. Usually whenpeople ask for recommendations on a beginner VN this is the one I give - it's fairly long (around~1.1 million characters) but that's good for a beginner as it gives you substantial time to get used tothe reading style, the sentences are simple and more than anything it's a brilliant VN (my biascoming in to play there of course but I had a blast with it ).A great site for getting a rough ballpark figure of how difficult you can expect a certain novel or VNto be is [jpdb.io](https://jpdb.io/), roughly speaking most VNs rated 4/10 and below for difficulty are beginner-friendly (although there are some exceptions so it can be a good idea to ask in a VNclub/experienced people about their thoughts). I began a 9-5 summer job towards the end of Junebut even so I was spending 5-6 hours reading every day (and slightly more on weekends), mylistening immersion time took a drastic drop as a result though . The main reason being that I was



 just really enjoying the VN I was reading and wanted to keep going. This is what I think is thesingle most effective way to read more - choose content that highly interests you.My average immersion time for June was ~7 hours a day. By the end of June, I also fully stoppedusing JP subs when watching anime and was only mining vocab from LNs and VNs (so I was onlyusing anime for listening immersion). Just around ~1 month after I passed the N4 Kotoba quiz and<2 weeks into reading my second VN Summer Pockets, I managed to pass the N3 Kotoba quiz(although it did take quite a few tries ). I was hugely surprised at how quickly my vocab had



managed to grow as a result of reading! By now, I had gotten used to reading Summer Pockets aswell and was encountering unknown vocab/grammar a lot less frequently (and it was taking a lotless time to process what I was reading), causing my reading speed for it to grow to 10,000characters/hour around the beginning of July. The first few weeks of July passed much the same -with me doing my Anki and an hour of listening immersion in the morning, working from 9-5, andthen reading for 5-6 hours in the evening. Just before the last week of July I finished my summer job (as it was for a 1 month period) and so decided I'd challenge myself to read more that week.Additionally, I was going to be busier next month so I wanted to immerse as much as possible whileI still could.In that final week of July, I ended up reading 100,000 characters in a day for the first time (I wasreading Summer Pockets at about 13,000 characters/hour by this point) - before going on to hit100,000 characters in a day another 3 times that same week. I did a total of 80 hours of immersionthat week (so an average of 11.4 hours a day) - 47 hours of reading and 33 hours of listening.Within that week I finished off the rest of Summer Pockets, started another VN and finished my 3rdLN. Also, I took part in TheMoeWay's immersion leaderboard for July and managed to win thatmonth. At the end of the month I changed all of my sentence cards on Anki into anime cards since

I'd noticed that far too often I was able to remember a card purely based on the context before Ieven got to reading the word. As a result, I was still repping 30-40 new cards a day but it was takingalmost half the time per day that it did with sentence cards. My retention rate dipped slightly for ashort while after the change but quickly got back to normal. For July as a whole, my averageimmersion was ~7.5 hours a day.I went away on holiday for a few days in early August during which I didn't do any immersion andwas busy with other things during the month such as moving house. Plus, with COVID-19restrictions pretty much gone I wanted to spend a lot more time with family and friends that month.But overall I still got a decent amount done. By halfway through the month, I'd finished another 2VNs (one of which I'd already started in July). I then started a VN called

白昼夢の青写真

, which isone of the best VNs I've read yet (Case 0 in particular is a brilliant read). (Side note: I recommendreading something that's roughly around your current level but which you still find interesting - ifyou read something far more difficult than you can handle you won't understand a whole lot andwon't get much out of it, on the other hand if you don't gradually increase the difficulty of the stuffyou read your growth will stagnate. For me, I had a lot of different LNs and VNs I wanted to readand slowly worked through them in order of increasing difficulty, very roughly speaking.)Around the same time I also started making the monolingual transition, i.e. transitioning over tousing J-J dictionaries rather than J-E dictionaries. Since I'd read a fair amount by this point, I foundit to be a fairly smooth transition but it still took time to get used to and my reading speed droppedfor quite a while. I often mined common words that I would see in definitions too. Up till now I hadmostly been mining words in i+1 sentences (i.e. I'd mine something if it was the only piece ofvocab/grammar I didn't know in the sentence) but I stopped following that rule and instead wouldmine even multiple pieces of unknown vocab from the same sentence as long as I could understandtheir meaning in that context. Furthermore, I had been very reserved with what I mined to Anki upto this point since I figured that particularly while I'm still new to reading I'll be able to acquire a lotof the more common stuff just by reading a lot so I would only mine words that I could tell forsome reason would be difficult to remember (or if they contained unfamiliar kanji or had a meaningwhich is not obvious from the kanji). But from this point on I started being just a bit more lax withthat. Oh, and I also managed to pass the Kotoba N2 quiz in early August . For August I was doing



an average of 4-5 hours of immersion a day.

~5.5 Months to ~8.5 Months (1st September 2021 - 5th December 2021):

September was a huge month for me in my Japanese language journey. In early September Idecided to sign up for the December JLPT N1 test on a whim as I figured it would be a cool sidegoal to have. At the time I wasn't sure if I'd even be able to get good enough to scrape a pass on it intime for December. However, I sure as hell was going to try. I decided to really challenge myself toimmerse as much as I could in September. Around the beginning of the month I also began aninternship I had lined up, but luckily it was quite flexible with timings (my day could be anythingfrom 9-3 or 8-6 purely based on how quickly I got the project work I was responsible for done).Also, since it was remote I didn't have to waste time commuting. So I tried to be as time-efficient aspossible, essentially finishing by 3 everyday and managing to get 6-10 hours of immersion in everyday (some in the morning and in my lunch breaks lol), as well as 10-12 hours on weekends.

I managed to finish the month with a total of 292 hours of immersion (average of 9.7 hours a day) -consisting of 2 million+ characters read from VNs and LNs, 20,000+ manga pages (yes, I gothooked on manga again this month lol) and 33 hours of listening. The majority of the characters Iread this month came from LNs (completed a total of 14 books) - before this point I had mostly readVNs so at first I found it difficult to read the same amount in a day with LNs as with VNs, but overthe course of the month I got used to it and was comfortably managing to read 100,000 characters aday with LNs too. I won my second month with TheMoeWay monthly immersion leaderboard andalso won the[Tadoku](https://tadoku.app/) reading competition for that month. In addition, at the end of the month Imanaged to pass the Kotoba N1 Grammar quiz (the highest role on the server) and was feeling a lotmore confident about being able to pass N1! After the intense period of immersion that wasSeptember, I also felt significant improvements in my reading ability.October was a very busy month for me between finishing off my internship, starting uni again (myholidays had finished), preparing grad job applications and other commitments. From early on inmy Japanese language journey I'd been building up a large backlog of new cards in my miningdeck. This was mainly because I never set a limit on how much I mined in a day, so there were oftendays where I'd mine like 50-100 new cards (meaning that my backlog kept growing faster than Iwas repping new cards). In order to try and catch up with it I began repping 50 new cards a dayfrom then on. Not much else significant happened in October other than perhaps the fact I startedreading a VN called Dies Irae during the month. It was probably the hardest thing I had read up tothat point and I came across a load of vocab I hadn't seen before. Also, I found there were manylines I'd have to reread and think about for a while before being able to fully understand. As a result,my reading speed during the prologue of Dies Irae was about 7,000 characters/hour and even by theend of October I was only averaging 10,000-11,000 characters/hour on it.I read quite a wide range of different texts during the month including LNs, VNs, web novels, blogsand just surfing random articles on the internet. Additionally, I tried my first reading stream in theserver during that month by reading Dies Irae out loud - found it really fun and have done moresince then. My average immersion time for October was 4.5 hours a day. At the end of October Idecided to try my first N1 practice paper to see where I'm at and, to my surprise, I managed to get araw score of 89/105 on it. This gave me the realisation that I was already able to pass N1 with quitea good score. My original plan was to mix in some JLPT-specific study in November but aftergetting that score I decided not to, and just continued immersing as normal.November was mostly the same, being occupied by other responsibilities and only averaging about4 hours of immersion a day up until the last week of the month. After that point, however, I hadsignificantly more free time available again up until the end of December. With slightly over a weekto go before the N1 test, I decided to challenge myself again by trying to read 1 million charactersin a week at the end of November. I managed to achieve this goal by reading a total of 61.5 hoursduring that week and also managed to read 200,000 characters in a day for the first time. Anki wasalso going well, and by now never took me more than 30 minutes a day (even while doing 50 newcards a day with around 92-95% retention). I get questions regarding best ways to increase retentionon Anki and what I personally found is that just trying to read more helped a lot more than fiddlingwith Anki settings, as it increases your familiarity with kanji and you're more likely to see the wordsyou've mined again (although of course I understand that isn't feasible for everyone and a little bitof time spent optimising the settings isn't the worst thing in the world, it's just that it is a lot lesseffective).

And so, that brings us up to 5th December, on which I took the JLPT N1 test and passed witha full score of 180/180.

 Even though I had never read any news(/typical non-fiction stuff people sayclosely emulates N1 reading passages) or done any JLPT prep at all, I still found the N1 readingsection very easy and managed to finish with about 15 minutes remaining despite closely readingevery passage and thinking a lot about every answer. Furthermore, I found grammar to be probablythe easiest section along with reading despite having never studied any grammar. This highlights theeffectiveness of focused reading - whenever I read in Japanese I always tried my best to understandas much as I possibly could and think deeply about what I read (including thinking about e.g. whatthe writer's trying to portray, the underlying message, what different character's motives are, etc.)and that reading comprehension ability translated over well to the JLPT N1.

Stats (up to the date of the N1 test):Total Immersion Time - 1,547 hoursTotal Reading Time - 1062 hoursTotal Listening Time - 485 hoursTotal Anki Time - 148 hoursAverage Time Spent Per Day - ~6.5 hours~8.5 Months to Now (5th December 2021 - Present):

As mentioned earlier, I had more free time in December which I used to read more of the things Ihad been looking forward to (one of the VNs I read called Musicus is great and I would highlyrecommend it!). I ended up immersing a total of 255 hours in December (average: 8-9 hours a day)- including 3 million+ characters read and 55 hours of listening immersion. Already I feel a lotbetter than I was at the point when I took the N1 test and reading in Japanese has come to feel verynatural for me. Thanks to that I'm able to enjoy a whole range of VNs, LNs, web novels, etc.effortlessly and it's honestly a great feeling. Doing this much focused reading over a month reallygets you used to it - when I started out with reading it felt like there was always this insurmountablebarrier in terms of how every time I read in Japanese I'd have to actively exert myself andconcentrate to understand (unlike in English where it's just natural). Took a lot of immersion/effort(and reading wasn't the most fun in the beginning) but now enjoying content has never felt so fun.I can now comfortably finish an average 100,000 character LN in 5-6 hours. Also, I finally caughtup on my Anki backlog about 2 weeks ago (mid-January) and surpassed 10,000 cards on Anki(although this isn't indicative of my vocab amount since I learnt a lot more vocab purely throughreading rather than from Anki). During the past week I've only done about 35 new cards in Ankisince it's hard to find new cards to mine at this point unless I purposely try to find really difficultmaterial that will use more obscure kanji. For example, I read White Album 2 Introductory Chapterwhich is ~210,000 characters long recently but only managed to mine about 20 words. So nowadaysin Anki I mostly just end up doing reviews.I've also passed the 1900 hours of immersion mark and will probably hit the 2000 mark next month.I didn't talk much about output but essentially I started being a lot more conscious about trying to

ouput from October onwards. At first it was really difficult, but just trying to think more in Japaneseand purposely looking out for how things are conveyed in my immersion has made a noticeabledifference. I make significantly less mistakes in my writing output nowadays and my speakingability is also coming along quite well (I can more comfortably speak about a range of topics now)but there is still a ways to go and I will be putting more focus on it this year. I'm also doing morelistening nowadays (my reading:listening ratio for this month has been 1:1).

Closing Comments and Future Plans:

Learning Japanese as an extra hobby over the past 10+ months has been great and I certainly won'tstop reading anytime soon as there's still loads of LNs and VNs I want to read. However, I'm goingto be spending far less time on it from now on and will be spending more time on/prioritising otherendeavours. Not to mention I need be studying more for uni in the buildup to exams as well aspreparing for grad job interviews. In terms of my language learning goals specifically, I will spendmore time speaking Japanese with natives this year to improve how natural my speaking ability isand I'm also thinking of starting to learn Arabic eventually (by eventually, I mean probably notwithin this year).Note that where I talk about 'efficiency' or the best way to go about something it's just referring tomy thoughts on it and what would, hypothetically, be the best way to go about it in my experience.At the end of the day, as long as you keep going you will make it. It's completely fine to makesacrifices on efficiency if it makes the process more enjoyable and sustainable for you. Also, I can'tstress enough the effectiveness of focused reading - getting enough good quality immersion willmake up for any imperfections in your learning method in the long run.I get asked sometimes about how I can read so much but one thing to note is that, personally, evenmore so than aspects such as discipline it's largely that I just really enjoyed the content I wasconsuming as well as the feeling of learning a new skill and most of the time it did not feel likestudy to me.

Here's some general tips I wrote up about a month ago answering common questions I'dgotten regarding the topic of getting good quickly/taking N1 purely using immersion:

This ended up being a lot longer than expected but it was a nice trip down memory lane andhopefully there was something useful in here for you. If you need to contact me for anything thenDiscord would be the best way (Jazzy#1234). You can usually catch me on TheMoeWay server aswell, where I've often posted progress reports and reviews for a lot of the stuff I've read.
